        When we create an object from a class it could be mutable or immutable

        StringBuilder -- mutable
        StringBuffer -- mutable

        -if we use immutable class to create an object. The object will be immutable
        -as long as new value is *not assigned immutable data original value cannot be changed
        - even if you use a method

        -everytime we use a method onm immutable object, Java creates a new object
        --unused objects are cleaned by java using garbage collector

        //Amr's summary
        /*
         In general, immutable objects are preferred in Java because they are thread-safe and can be shared more easily
         between different parts of a program without worrying about unexpected changes to their state.
         However, mutable objects can be useful in situations where performance is a concern and frequent modifications to the object are required
