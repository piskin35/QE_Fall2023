    /*
    1) Interface is not class. it is Interface
    2) Best feature of an Interface is allowing multiple parents.
    3) All methods inside an Interface have to be abstract with no method body, even if abstract key word is not used. (this is r=the reason why Interfaces are called full abstract
    4) All Interface methods are public
    5) If you want an Interface to be the parent of a class instead of "extends" use "implements"
    6) If a class has two parent Interface. Both can have the same name sae return type method. Java will not complain, It will use one of them
            However, if the return types are different, java will complain. It needs to be fixed in Interfaces
    7) All variables in Interfaces are public final and static.
    8) Like abstract classes, we cannot create objects from Interfaces
    9) Interface doesn't have to override from parent Interface
       Abstract class doesn't have to override from parent Interface (Like abstract class doesn't have to override from a parent abstract class)
       ***CONCRETE class has to override from parent Interface
    10)     Child                Parent
            Concrete class ==> interface : implements
            Abstract class ==> interface : implements
            Interface      ==> interface : extends
            Interface      ==> Concrete class : This is not allowed in Java. (A class cannot be a parent of an interface)
            Interface      ==> Abstract class : This is not allowed in Java. (A class cannot be a parent of an interface)
